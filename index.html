            <p>WOW! Looking back over 2012, the Zaiches have been quite busy. Overall, we feel so blessed to have been together for two years and counting. Our families are doing well, full of love and happiness. We are thankful for the strong marriages we have as role models both in our friends and in our family.

            Starting off the New Year, Paul and I headed down to Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl. Our first road trip together, we had a blast listening to audio books, finding restrooms, and stretching our legs. We spend some time at the Grand Canyon and in Sonora. Both places were incredibly breathtaking. Having never been to either place, seeing the immense size of the Canyon blew me away. Onto more important topics, the Fiesta Bowl was a blast until our final 30 seconds, as we all know. So many friends were there, so it was wonderful to connect and to catch up with people we hadn’t seen in a long time. 
            </p>

            My school year at Covington was a busy one. I taught sixth grade again, but took on more responsibility. I was lead teacher with two new teachers as my partners, both wonderful ladies. I loved being able to teach sixth grade again at the same school, and it was exciting to learn about how to be in a leadership role. Walking on the weekdays with two of my colleagues was wonderful and a great way to connect outside of school. The annual school auction was so, so fun as it is always exciting to get dressed up for various events. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In February, we found ourselves with 24 hours to decide the next two years of our lives. Paul and I have always discussed living abroad, but it had never been a reality until this past year. I began looking into teaching abroad and we became excited about the possibility of spending two years overseas. However, I wanted a school that I felt would support my growth as a teacher. I went to a job fair in SF in February and was contacted by Korea International School in South Korea. Knowing very little about Korea, I went to the interview on Friday and was offered a job on Saturday and had to decide by Sunday. So, surrounded by good friends at Trader Vick’s on Saturday night we pondered the next two years and decided to pull the trigger. South Korea here we come!

            Paul had a busy work year as well. He transitioned fully into his web developer position at Finis. Additionally, he was swimming and lifting a ton trying to make Olypmic Trials. He came so close! It was very fun to watch him strive for a goal and be satisfied with the outcome.
            </p> 
            <p>
            Come March he applied for Dev BootCamp, which is a 10-week, highly intensive programming course. Yipppy! He was accepted and moved to working part time for Finis in May in preparation for starting what became a 9 am to midnight job complete with the delicious donut on the way home in SF.

            In April, we found ourselves sun tanning on the gorgeous beaches of Maui—a trip we planned almost 10 months earlier when I was told I still had my teaching job (a silent fear all new teachers live with, but I now have tenure in Los Altos which is very exciting). Maui was amazing. We spend time snorkeling, touring the beaches, driving into various towns and eating delicious food. The relaxation and rejuvenation was great and gave me a jump-start for the remainder of my school year.

            June became a whirlwind of this and that. I finished out my school year at Covington, Paul started Dev BootCamp and was living in SF during the week, and we were packing up our lives in preparation for moving in August. I spend most of June enjoying my zumba class (amazing dance workout), cooking, packing, and seeing friends. Paul spent most of his time working, programing, coding and working (I think he slept a bit in there). It was a great month for us to spend time with family, however it was hard to be apart yet be so close. My wonderful parents took me out for my birthday as Paul was busy at Tanner’s bachelor party. It was wonderful though because I got to have two birthdays : )  
            </p>
            <p>
            In July, our good friend Tanner Gardner got married so we headed to Houston for his wedding. We had a blast dancing and mingling with old friends and new friends. Towards the end of July, I taught a two-week summer school class on design thinking and participated in a weeklong edtech intensive professional development. Additionally, I became certified to teach zumba because I wanted to continue with classes in Korea. Paul continued his programming course, learning more and more each day. I am so glad that he took a leap and decided to go for it and take this class as I see how much he enjoys it even to this day. 
            </p>

            Paul and I celebrated our two-year anniversary with a picnic in the oval and new Stanford sweatshirts. It was wonderful to be able to look back on two years of marriage and think about the lessons we’ve learned, the joys we’ve had and the love we share. My departure date was quickly approaching as well, so that did add quite a bit of stress and tension. I realize now looking back that I was incredibly nervous about moving to Korea without Paul for the first few weeks.

            Well, July 28th came and my parents piled our 5 boxes and 2 suitcases into the car and we drove to SFO. Making it there quite early in proper Bell fashion, we relaxed in the food court and talked about everything but me leaving. Tears and hugs and kisses were the final farewell before I stepped into that winding line through security. Now, just a plane flight and I would find myself in a new courtier that I would call home for the next two years.

            So begins our South Korean adventures. Our blog has unfortunately been set aside due to all the experiences we are having, I guess no excuse for sharing but oh well. Since moving to South Korea we’ve moved (our first place was very far from KIS and very dark which made it hard for Paul to work), now we are settled into our new apartment. Paul and I enjoy exploring Seoul proper on the weekends by going into Gangnam (super hip area of Seoul), Insadong (tourist area), and Itaewon (expat area and foreign food mart where you can buy many US items you can’t get any where else). We’ve seen famous palaces, a national park, Swan Lake and more. Additionally, we feel so blessed to have met many friends outside of KIS. Sonja (a Stanford 2009er) has been a great friend and we enjoy grabbing coffee at the MILLIONS of cafes around town. I just recently met up with an old synchro coach, SooHee, and her family. I am looking forward to spending more time with them. Paul has connected with programmers and entrepreneurs so he is enjoying dinners and coffees with them as well.

            <p>
            We recently went to a Stanford Alumni dinner at a very nice hotel. While there we met many awesome Stanford grads, heard a lecture in Korean (good experience as usually everything is in English in many countries) and ate amazing food. Paul and I have had fun watching football games with Stanford friends as well. We are sad to be missing the Rose Bowl, but will enjoy our holiday in Kenya with Jason Dunford and his family. Thus far our travels have taken us to Mongolia and we will be visiting Bali and Hong Kong over the summer.
            </p> 
            <p>
            In general, Paul and I feel so blessed by friends and family. The support we felt when moving here was incredible and while we so miss being close to everyone we are having many wonderful experiences abroad. My students here are kind and wonderful. Paul is enjoying freelancing as a programmer right now and has had quite a few interviews with Korean startups (a bit too far from where we live though). I am learning so much about edtech and innovation that I look back on where I started three years ago as a teacher and can see how much I have grown in just that time.
            </p>
            <p>
            We hope that everyone has had a wonderful 2012 and we are looking forward to what 2013 has in store for you all.

            Happy Holidays!
